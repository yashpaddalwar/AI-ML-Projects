3. Deep learning based Brain Tumor Multiclass Classification
Description: A brain tumor is a kind of cancer that can impact people, sometimes fatally or with significant quality of life impairment. Using Deep learning techniques, researchers can identify tumors and treat them more efficiently. Brain MRI pictures can be used in a variety of ways to find malignancies. Deep learning techniques have significantly outperformed the rest of these techniques. Within the framework, comparison of the models has been employed for tumor detection from brain MRI scans. Among the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures that can be employed are Custom CNN, DenseNet169, MobileNet, VGG-16, and ResNet152 models. The same hyper-parameters can be used to train these models on MR images that have undergone the same dataset and preprocessing procedures. The goal is to develop an architecture that will compare various models to classify the Brain Tumor MRI. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be used to directly scan and determine the presence and type of tumor. Therefore, it is useful for analyzing brain tumor detection performance using various methods. The dataset used for Brain Tumor Detection consists of approximately 5000 Brain MR Images.

4. Customer Churn Prediction
Description: Customer getting Churned is a big loss for the company and businesses hence a model is built where the churn possibility will be predicted along with the chances so that business can target those customers with some set of offers resulting increase in sales

6. Heart Disease Predictor
Description: Implemented four different models to assess heart disease risk for early diagnosis. Used different techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to find the best performing model. Built a Website to predict single as well as bulk of records at once with interactive features.
